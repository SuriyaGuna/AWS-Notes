DMS - Data Migration Service

Database Migrations - on-prem to Cloud
CDC - Change Data Capture - As the changes occur in the Database they are written to Logs. The process reads the log files 

Logging Options - 

- Full Logging - Any change to a single column - will log the whole record - Best Option - this is the worst option for database performance and storage
- Primary Key Logging - Any change the Table Name and primary key is logged - We dont know what was changed  - Separate process needs to qeury primary key to find what was changed 
- Primary Key + Changed Fields are logged - Table, Primary Key and Changed Data

                                                Lambda needs permission to write/Read to S3 - Role associated to the Lambda has permissions to read/write S3
